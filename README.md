# Hi, I'm Fatimah ðŸ‘‹
3rd-year Data Science student | Building reliable, reproducible ML projects | Aspiring AI Scientist

## Flagship project
- [**Cool Neighbourhoods**](https://coolneighbourhoods.nweurope.eu/) â€” part of an [Interreg](https://interreg.eu/) initiative to address urban heat stress. This project applies the CRISP-DM framework to build supervised regression models for temperature prediction, using multi-site sensor data (temperature, humidity, and related environmental variables) from pilot locations in the Benelux region.

## Interests
- Machine learning for urban systems â€¢ spatiotemporal modelling â€¢ model reliability & evaluation

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, scikit-learn
